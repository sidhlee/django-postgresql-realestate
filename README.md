# Python Django Dev to Deployment

A code-along repo for the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-dev-to-deployment/)

## Python Review

### Tuples

- Tuples in python are immutable data structure. You can't reassign values to them once they're initialized.
- You can create a single-value tuple with trailing comma.
- You can't mutate tuples, but you can `delete` them.

## venv

venv is a python module for creating virtual environments.

You can create a virtual environment by:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in the current directory
python3 -m venv .
```

You can activate the created environment:

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Try absolute path if it doesn't work.

Once activated, the python version will default to the version that was used to create this environment.

```bash
(venv) ➜  django-postgresql-realestate python --version
Python 3.9.1
```

Check if the environment is isolated from the main system by:

```bash
pip freeze
# will show no packages installed
```

To leave the environment, you can deactivate it.

```bash
deactivate

pip freeze
# will show all pip packages installed globally
```

## Project setup with Django

1. Activate venv
2. Install Django `pip install django`
3. Create requirements file `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
4. Create `.gitignore`
5. Create `.env` and paste `SECRET_KEY` from `settings.py`
6. Replace secret key inside `settings.py` with env variable.

   ```python
   from decouple import config

   # Access value from .env file
   SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')
   ```

7. Init Git
8. Commit

## Django CLI commands

Django creates `manage.py` inside root folder. You can run this file with various options to do server-related tasks.

### Start server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Create an app

Django app is a sub-module of a project that can function independently and therefore can be easily used in other projects.

```bash
python manage.py startapp appname
```

## Trouble Shoot

### Appending app config to `INSTALLED_APPS` results in `ModuleNotFoundError`

When you're registering your app in `settings.py` you need to add the config after all the pre-installed django apps.
`settings.py`

```python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
# custom apps must come after default apps
'pages.apps.PagesConfig'
]

```
